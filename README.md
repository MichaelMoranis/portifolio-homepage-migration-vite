# My Portfolio - Migration to Vite

Welcome to my project documenting the migration of my portfolio from CRA to Vite!

## Overview

This is a space where I share my work and experiences in a way that reflects who I am as a developer. Recently, I made the decision to migrate my portfolio from React with Create React App (CRA) to Vite, and I'd like to share a bit about this process and the reasons behind this change.

## Why Vite?

Vite is an incredible tool for front-end development, known for its speed and simplicity. The decision to migrate to Vite was based on the quest for performance optimization and exploring modern technologies.

## About the Project

In this repository, you will find the source code for my new portfolio, now built with Vite. It represents an exciting chapter in my development journey.
